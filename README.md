# `kill-my-port` ‚Äì Kill Processes Running on a Port Instantly üöÄ

`kill-my-port` is a simple and efficient CLI tool that helps developers **quickly free up ports** by terminating processes running on them. It works across **Windows, macOS, and Linux** and provides an **interactive mode** if no port is specified.

## üì¶ Installation

### **Option 1: Run Without Installation (NPX)**

You can use `kill-my-port` instantly without installing it:

```sh
npx kill-my-port 3000
```

### **Option 2: Install Globally (for Persistent Use)**

To use `kill-my-port` as a command without `npx`:

```sh
npm install -g kill-my-port
```

Now, you can run it like this:

```sh
kill-my-port 3000
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Kill a Process on a Specific Port**

```sh
kill-my-port 3000
```

This will **find and terminate** the process using port `3000`.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Auto-Detect Running Ports and Choose One to Kill**

If you run the command **without specifying a port**, it will **list active ports** and let you pick one:

```sh
kill-my-port
```

Example output:

```
üîç Active ports:

COMMAND    PID   USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
node      1234  user    22u  IPv4 0x1234  0t0  TCP 127.0.0.1:3000 (LISTEN)
python    5678  user    23u  IPv4 0x5678  0t0  TCP 127.0.0.1:5000 (LISTEN)

Enter a port to kill: 3000
‚ùó Kill process running on port 3000? (y/n): y
‚úÖ Port 3000 has been freed.
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Handling a Port Not in Use**

If you try to kill a port that has no active process, it will inform you:

```sh
kill-my-port 8000
```

```
‚ö†Ô∏è No process is running on port 8000.
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Internally, `kill-my-port` executes OS-specific commands to find and terminate processes:

| **OS**          | **Command Used** |
| --------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Windows**     | `netstat -ano    | findstr :PORT`+`taskkill /PID <PID> /F` |
| **macOS/Linux** | `lsof -ti :PORT  | xargs kill -9`                          |

This ensures proper compatibility across different operating systems.

## üöë Troubleshooting

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Command Not Found (`kill-my-port: command not found`)**

- If using `kill-my-port` without `npx`, ensure it‚Äôs installed globally:
  ```sh
  npm install -g kill-my-port
  ```
- If installed but still not found, try:
  ```sh
  npx kill-my-port 3000
  ```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Permission Denied on macOS/Linux**

If you see a permission error, try:

```sh
sudo kill-my-port 3000
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Port Not Found (`No process is running on port X`)**

- Ensure the process is actually running by using:
  ```sh
  netstat -ano | findstr :3000  # Windows
  lsof -i :3000                 # macOS/Linux
  ```
- Try running `kill-my-port` **without a port number** to list all active ports.
